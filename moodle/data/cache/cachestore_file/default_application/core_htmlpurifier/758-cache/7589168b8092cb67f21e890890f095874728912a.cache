s:1856:"<p></p><p><b><span style="font-size:16pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:#262626;">When I ask teachers what their
biggest struggles are,</span></b><span style="font-size:16pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:#262626;"> one issue comes up on
a regular basis: student motivation. You are able to reach many of your
students, but others are unreachable. No matter what you try, they have no
interest in learning, no interest in doing quality work, and you are out of
ideas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:21.33333396911621px;">Some research states the following:</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;"><span style="font-size:16pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:#262626;">Students are more motivated
academically when they have a <b>positive relationship</b> with their
teacher.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;"><b><span style="font-size:16pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:#262626;">Choice</span></b><span style="font-size:16pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:#262626;"> is a powerful motivator in most educational contexts.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;"><span style="font-size:16pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:#262626;">For complex tasks that require
creativity and persistence, <b>extrinsic rewards and consequences actually
hamper motivation</b>.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;"><span style="font-size:16pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:#262626;">To stay motivated to persist at
any task, students must believe they can <b>improve</b> in that task.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;"><span style="font-size:16pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:#262626;">Students are motivated to learn
things that have <b>relevance</b> to their lives.</span></p><br /><p></p><p>http://www.cultofpedagogy.com/student-motivation/<br /></p>";
