Most of us have probably heard this, but we may not have fully embraced it. After all, providing choice can be messy, with students completing different tasks at different rates, making it hard to be consistent with grading. It can also mean a lot more prep work: If you’re going to give students three different options for an assignment, that means you have to prepare all three options ahead of time. Or do you? </span></p><p><span style="color:rgb(38,38,38);font-family:Helvetica;font-size:21.3333px;font-style:normal;font-weight:500;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;">Isn’t that kind of prep work more in line with worksheet-oriented teaching, where students are doing low-level work that was largely prepared by the teacher? </span></p><p><span style="color:rgb(38,38,38);font-family:Helvetica;font-size:21.3333px;font-style:normal;font-weight:500;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;">If students are engaged in more long-term, authentic, creative projects, it’s much easier to provide them with choices, because we aren’t constantly trying to provide them with new busywork every day.</span><br /></p><p><span style="color:rgb(38,38,38);font-family:Helvetica;font-size:21.3333px;font-style:normal;font-weight:500;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;">Obviously providing choices for every activity in the classroom learning is very difficult and can be impossible depending on the learning objective. What are some activities of choices can you create for students' learning in your content area?</span></p>";
